# volumeHUD

## This fork: keyboard brightness HUD

This fork adds an experimental **Keyboard Brightness HUD**, enabled by default in the non-sandbox app. It reuses the classic 16-segment overlay for the built-in keyboard and can be switched off independently in settings. **Only keyboard-illumination key presses trigger it**; automatic brightness, idle dimming, and slider changes do not start a HUD. It uses the existing Accessibility-authorized key tap to adjust the backlight directly and suppress Apple's keyboard indicator. If keyboard control is unavailable, it passes keys to macOS so they keep working. The supplied [standard key-remapping template](extras/com.local.KeyRemapping.plist) works with the same event path.

Build this fork to use the addition. Xcode places the app in `build/Debug/volumeHUD.app` or `build/Release/volumeHUD.app` inside the project folder. The upstream Homebrew installation described below does **not** include it. See [keyboard HUD behavior, limitations, and Mac validation](KEYBOARD-HUD.md). The upstream project description follows.

## This fork: Shift controls external brightness

With **Brightness HUD** enabled, **Shift + display-brightness up/down** controls a compatible external monitor and shows the classic HUD on that screen. The external screen under the pointer has priority when several are connected. Native DisplayServices and DDC/CI hardware control are supported where the monitor and connection expose them. Plain brightness keys and the existing Option+Shift fine steps keep their behavior.

See [external display compatibility and verification](EXTERNAL-DISPLAY-BRIGHTNESS.md). Build output remains inside `build/`.

A simple macOS app that brings back the classic volume and brightness HUDs.

**PLEASE NOTE: volumeHUD is feature-complete and no longer under active development.** This is an app I built for myself and it does everything it's supposed to. I'm very glad it's found an appreciative audience, but I am not accepting PRs and no further updates are planned except to fix bugs and maintain macOS compatibility.

## Why This Exists

With macOS Tahoe, Apple revamped Control Center and replaced the classic volume and brightness indicators of 25 years with tiny popovers in the corner of the screen, even smaller than notifications. They're hard to see, especially against light backgrounds, and they disappear before I remember where to look. Even after months on the Tahoe beta I haven't gotten used to them. It's bad UI.

So I did what any sane person would do: I picked up Xcode and wrote my first ever Mac app to bring back the classic macOS HUDs we all know and love (except Apple, apparently). They do what any good system indicator should do: they show you the level when you change it and then they go away. And get this—you can actually *see them*. A groundbreaking feature in 2025.

## What It Looks Like

## Usage

Just launch the app! You should see a notification that it started, and you can begin enjoying your new (old) volume HUD right away. If you launch the app a second time, you'll get a window where you can set it to open at login, configure HUD preferences, and quit. It will also show when an update is available.

As of version 2.0, volumeHUD supports brightness. It is **off by default** (this is *volumeHUD*, after all), and it is **experimental and unsupported**. It will only work for built-in displays, and it may not be bulletproof for automatic changes like power source or ambient light, though it does mostly catch these.

As of version 3.0, **volumeHUD hides the system HUD**. It does this by intercepting the volume/brightness keys and handling volume/brightness changes directly, instead of having the OS do it. There is a safety check to make sure the volume/brightness has actually changed after you press a key; if not, the app assumes key interception is not working and disables it until a device change or the app is restarted. This ensures you can still change volume or brightness even if this doesn't work on your system.

## Installation

You can download it from the repo, but I strongly recommend installing via Homebrew, as that will handle updates for you. It's my first Swift app, so I don't want you to be left with any lingering bugs.

```bash
brew install dannystewart/apps/volumehud
```

You can uninstall with `brew uninstall volumehud`, which should remove all traces of the app, including preferences and login item. No permissions should be left behind either once the app is gone.

## Permissions

I worked hard to ensure the app could function without requiring any permissions. It will request two that are **optional but recommended**.

- **Notifications** are used only to confirm the app has started (and only when launched manually, not as a login item). Feel free to disable if you find them unnecessary.
- **Accessibility** is needed for full functionality. The app will work without it, but you lose some features:
  - The system HUD will still appear alongside volumeHUD.
  - The HUD won't appear if you go below 0% or above 100% since it can't use key presses to determine if levels should have changed.
  - Brightness checks may be less reliable since key timing can't be used to check whether a change is user-initiated.

Apart from that, all other features should work.

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing inconsistent behavior, the most likely cause is lack of Accessibility permissions, and the first thing I would recommend is a full reset. The most thorough way to do this is to uninstall and reinstall:

1. Completely quit volumeHUD by opening it a second time and clicking **Quit volumeHUD** or by running `pkill -f volumeHUD`
2. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**.
3. Find **volumeHUD** in the list, select it, and click the minus (-) button at the bottom. Make sure it's removed from the list.
4. Assuming you installed with Homebrew, run `brew uninstall volumehud` to remove the login item, the app, and any remaining files.
5. Run `brew install dannystewart/apps/volumehud` to reinstall.
6. Reopen **volumeHUD.app**. You should be prompted with "this application has been downloaded from the internet" first, followed by a request for Accessibility permissions.
7. Open **System Settings** like it says to do, make sure **volumeHUD** is in the list now, and toggle it on. If it says you'll need to quit and reopen, do that and try again.

Alternatively, you can do the same reset from the command line:

```bash
pkill -f volumeHUD
tccutil reset Accessibility com.dannystewart.volumehud
tccutil reset ListenEvent com.dannystewart.volumehud
brew uninstall volumehud
brew install dannystewart/apps/volumehud
```

Then run the app again, grant the requested permissions, and triple-check everything in **System Settings**.
